	The Price-Sheet System allows Administrators to easily create, view, edit, and delete price-sheets, accessories, vehicles, features, and users.
<br /><br />Individual dealerships manage their own set of vehicle accessories. Salespeople (dealer-level users) are also able to login to the system and view useful information about vehicles (like MSRP).
<br /><br />The system was designed to streamline the price-sheet printing process as well as allowing for quicker &amp; easier maintenance, by Sage technicians.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
